# Routes folder

## Appointments.routes.ts
Responsible for routes related to our GoBarber's appointment feature.
Our routes are linked to <b> Repositories </b> folder that is responsible for operating and storing data
and <b> Models </b> folder that contains our data types.

As a default, our route should only <b>RECEIVE a request => call in another file (service, model, respository) => return a response</b>
